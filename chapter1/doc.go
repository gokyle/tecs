// Package chapter1 contains code from Chapter 1, Boolean Logic, of The
// Elements of Computing Systems.
//
// Currently, this consists of basic gate definitions. There are two
// types of gates, Pure<GATE> and <GATE>. The Pure* gates are permitted
// to only consist of NAND components, while the other form is permitted
// to use previously-defined gates.
